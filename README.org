#+TITLE: Experiments

This subdomain is a space for my web design and
development experiments.

It's deliberately not as accessible as my other publicly
hosted websites to allow for greater creative freedom
than development for the accessible web allows.

As such, some experiments may be performance intensive or
incompatible with certain browsers.
