#+TITLE: Todo
* TODO switch to server side rendering framework
worth exploring:
- razzle
- next.js
??? do i need the framework from next.js, really?
https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr dynamic imports with nextjs
to work with drei: lazy load the component using loadable-componnets
this wrks because lazy loaded components won't try to render server-side
(this might be a good idea for threejs canvas anyways!)
* TODO try babylonjs
this is probably the most robust framework ive found
https://doc.babylonjs.com/resources/babylonjs_and_reactjs
* TODO try p5js
this claims to make it as simple as possible to make creatived things with javascript

* TODO deploy the site
